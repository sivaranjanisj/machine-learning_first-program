Predicting Gold Rates with Machine Learning
This is my first project where I applied machine learning to predict gold prices.
In this project, I learned how to work with various Python libraries and encountered some challenges along the way, but I was able to resolve errors and improve my understanding. 
I also learned how to install and use new libraries, which was a valuable experience. 
As a beginner, this project has been a great learning opportunity, and Iâ€™m excited to continue improving my skills and learning more in the future.
